## Issues Fixed

| Stack | Issues Fixed | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Frontend | CSS: Content (text & images) not visible inside the containers of `Features` and `Our Team` sections in the home page in the production build. | Instead of using Opacity Percentage, used Opacity Decimal Values. <br> Example <br> `opacity: 90%;` ❌ <br> `opacity: 0.9;` ✅ |
| Backend | API: Unable to logout because the API was unable to delete the HTTP Cookie. | Due to the Chromium Engine's changes in Cookie Policies, we had to enable the `Secure` Cookie Attribute. |
