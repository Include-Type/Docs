## Issues Fixed

| Issues Fixed | Solution |
|--------------|----------|
|CSS: Content (text & images) not visible inside the containers of `Features` and `Our Team` sections in the home page in the production build. | Instead of using Opacity Percentage, used Opacity Decimal Values. <br> Example <br> `opacity: 90%;` ❌ <br> `opacity: 0.9;` ✅ |
